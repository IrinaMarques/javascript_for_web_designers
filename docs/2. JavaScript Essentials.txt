2.1 Variables
--------------
1. Variables
To declare a variable start with var.

Then identifiers have specifc rules they can contain letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs, they must begin with the letter.

Names are case sensitive - bob it's not the same as Bob
Reserved keywords from JavaScript are prohibited from being used as identifiers

var item,
    item2;

2. Values
Can specify a value

item = 5;
item2 = "Hello!";

Variables have something called a scope. Referes to the context in which these variables are available. 
In the previous case - item item2 - they have a global scope, they are available globally.

Later we'll see that it's possible to create a local scope inside, for example, a function or a specific block of code. in that case the variable which has local scope is only available within that function or that block of code
