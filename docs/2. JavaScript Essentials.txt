2.1 Variables
--------------
1. Variables
To declare a variable start with var.

Then identifiers have specifc rules they can contain letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs, they must begin with the letter.

Names are case sensitive - bob it's not the same as Bob
Reserved keywords from JavaScript are prohibited from being used as identifiers

var item,
    item2;

2. Values
Can specify a value

item = 5;
item2 = "Hello!";

Variables have something called a scope. Referes to the context in which these variables are available. 
In the previous case - item item2 - they have a global scope, they are available globally.

Later we'll see that it's possible to create a local scope inside, for example, a function or a specific block of code. in that case the variable which has local scope is only available within that function or that block of code.

2.2 Data Types
---------------

There are 7 data types in total:
- 5 primary 
- 2 composit

Primary:
- string - group of characters
- number
- boolean - can only hold two values - True or False
- null - single value that is null, it's used to erase the contents of a variable without deleting the variable itself
- undefined - when we trying to access an object property that doesn't exist or trying to access a variable that has not been given a value

The typeof operator - nice way of checking the type of variable
In the console on the beowser we write ex. 
typeof false - and will give "boolean"
typeof carModel - "undefined"
typeof name - "string"
typeof "false" - "string"
typeof age - "object" 

2.3 Arrays
-----------

Array it's a first "composite" data type in JavaScript.

Array it's a list of values.

In the console we write:
list
list2
list3

The lists goes from 0 to 4.
In the console we write:
list[0] --> "John"
list[2] --> "Sander"
list[5] --> undefined
list[4] --> false

Arrays have: 
- Properties
- Methods.

Properties - length property give you the number of items of that array
In the console we write:
list.length --> 5
list2.length --> 0
list3.length --> 2

Methods:
- push - add an item to the end of an array
- pop - remove one item from the end of the array
- shift - remove an item from the front or the start of an array
- unshift - add to the front of an array
- indexOf - to find the index of a specific item in an array

Ex. - push
In the console we write:
list.push("Hi!") --> 6
list --> Array["John", "Marie", "Sander", 32, false, "Hi!"]

Ex. - pop
In the console we write:
list.pop() --> "Hi!"
list --> Array["John", "Marie", "Sander", 32, false]

Ex. - shift
In the console we write:
list.shift() --> "John"
list --> Array["Marie", "Sander", 32, false]

Ex. - unshift
In the console we write:
list.unshift(10) --> "5"
list --> Array[10, "John", "Marie", "Sander", 32, false]

Ex. - indexOf
In the console we write:
list.indexOf(32) --> "3"
