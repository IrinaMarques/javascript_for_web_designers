2.1 Variables
--------------
1. Variables
To declare a variable start with var.

Then identifiers have specifc rules they can contain letters, digits, underscores and dollar signs, they must begin with the letter.

Names are case sensitive - bob it's not the same as Bob
Reserved keywords from JavaScript are prohibited from being used as identifiers

var item,
    item2;

2. Values
Can specify a value

item = 5;
item2 = "Hello!";

Variables have something called a scope. Referes to the context in which these variables are available. 
In the previous case - item item2 - they have a global scope, they are available globally.

Later we'll see that it's possible to create a local scope inside, for example, a function or a specific block of code. in that case the variable which has local scope is only available within that function or that block of code.

2.2 Data Types
---------------

There are 7 data types in total:
- 5 primary 
- 2 composit

Primary:
- string - group of characters
- number
- boolean - can only hold two values - True or False
- null - single value that is null, it's used to erase the contents of a variable without deleting the variable itself
- undefined - when we trying to access an object property that doesn't exist or trying to access a variable that has not been given a value

The typeof operator - nice way of checking the type of variable
In the console on the beowser we write ex. 
typeof false - and will give "boolean"
typeof carModel - "undefined"
typeof name - "string"
typeof "false" - "string"
typeof age - "object"
